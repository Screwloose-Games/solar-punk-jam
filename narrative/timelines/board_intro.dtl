A weather-beaten bulletin board, pieced together from scrap wood, stands defiantly against the elements.
Various slips of paper are fastened to it with tacks, nails, and pins. \
A riot of colors that somehow manages to make sense to the viewer.
Te: Yeesh, this thing looks like it's about to fall over. This is how we're supposed to ask for work and materials?
The board stands silent, which is a statement in of itself.
Te: Well, no use just staring at this thing. Gotta fill up my quota before I catch another lecture from Mom...
