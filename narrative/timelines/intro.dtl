Mom: TE!!!! RISE AND SHINE!
Te (sleepy): Mom...
Mom: Everyone’s gotta pull their weight around here, Te, and you promised you’d fill those bins up, remember?
Te (grumpy): I did that yesterday.
Mom: And now you’ll do it again, sweetie. Up up up!
Te (grumbles): I hate it here.
Mom: LOVE YOU TOO, GREMLIN!
