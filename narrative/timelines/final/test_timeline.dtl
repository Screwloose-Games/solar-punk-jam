# EXT. TRIN’S GARDEN
# Trin has just started her garden at this point, but she might have impressive looking, exotic plants already.
# We’ll find her crouched over some plants.

te: Hey, are you—
trin: Cornus sericea!
te: What?
trin: Some people call them Red Twig Dogwood.
trin: Mine prefer to be called Kay and Jay.
te: Good for them…I guess.
te: Are you Trin?
trin: Yup. You can start building over there.
te: Uhhh, I’m not sure how to do that.

# THIS BEGINS THE “GARDEN TUTORIAL”

trin: Even a Berberis thunbergii would know how to do this!
trin: Fine. I’ll walk you through it.

# TUTORIAL: ACCESS BUILD MODE TO VIEW UNLOCKED BUILDABLE ITEMS
# TUTORIAL: SELECT THE VERTICAL PLANTER
# TUTORIAL: PLACE THE VERTICAL PLANTER ON THE GRID

[label player_built_vertical_planter]

trin: Now decide where you want to build and leave your materials there.
te: Materials…?
trin: You don’t have—*sigh*.
trin: Normally you’d drop off *your own* materials at the build site and, since we’re great that way, everybody in the community would chip in and help build it for you.
trin: *But* since you came *unprepared*, I can go ahead and build it this *one* time.

# The vertical garden will appear right away, just for the tutorial (if possible @Jonathan Lewis).

trin: Since you’re here, you might as well help with the plants too.

# TUTORIAL: GRAB SOIL FROM THE COMPOST BIN

label player_interacted_with_compost_bin

trin: My compost already has soil in it, but usually you’d need to collect food waste and add it to the compost to make your own.

# TUTORIAL: GET WATER FROM THE RAIN BARREL

trin: Next is water! It rains every so often here and that helps us fill up the barrels.

# TUTORIAL: INTERACT WITH THE VERTICAL GARDEN TO OPEN PLANT MODE

trin: Next grab a seed and plant it in the vertical garden.
trin: These are a single yield crop, which just needs to be watered once you plant it.
trin: Recurring crops have to be watered after each time you harvest them.

# TUTORIAL: PLANT

# GARDEN TUTORIAL COMPLETE

trin: And that’s it!
te: That was fun!
trin: Really?
trin: What a weirdo.
te: *I’m the weirdo?*
trin: Here. If you like gardening so much, go build your own.

# Reward:
# - 3 seeds
# - 6 materials (for vertical planter, compost bin, and rain barrel)
# - 3 soil
# - 3 water
# (these will be used by the Player to build their own garden next)
