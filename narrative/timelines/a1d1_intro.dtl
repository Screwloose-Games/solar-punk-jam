Mom: GOOD MORNING, TE!

Te: *mumbles unintelligbly*

Mom: Shake that sleep off, honey.
Mom: It's another great day in Lumina and we've got work to do. 

Te: But I just got up!

Mom: We all have our part to play, and that's--

Te: -the only way to make this place a home. 
Te: I know, I know.

Mom: Good, then don't forget to check the bulletin board again, you hear me?

Te: Fine.

Mom: Love you too, my little gremlin.
