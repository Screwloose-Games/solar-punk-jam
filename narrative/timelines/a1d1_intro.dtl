Mom: TE, BABY! COME OVER HERE!

Te: Ugh, what now?

Mom: Don't "what now" me. We all have our part to play, that's the only way--

Te: -we can work with the land and each other to call this place a home. I know, I know. You say it all the time.

Mom: Good, then don't forget to check the bulletin board. If anyone needs help they'll ask for it there.

Te: Fine.

Mom: Love you too, my little gremlin.
