Mom: COME OVER HERE!

Te: Ugh, what now?

Mom: Don't what now me.

Mom: We all have our part to play, that's the only way--

Te: -we can work with the land and each other to call this place a home. 

Te: I know, I know. You say it all the time. 

Mom: Good, then don't forget to check the bulletin board. 

Mom: If anyone needs help they'll ask for it there. 

Te: Fine.

Mom: Love you too, my little gremlin.
