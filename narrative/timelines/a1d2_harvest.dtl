Mom: TEEEEE!!!

# Te runs out. 

Te: MAAAAAA!! Stop yelling!

Mom: Hey, baby. Your vegetables looks fantastic!

Mom: You should take them down to the food stand in the community hub.\
Your daily duty can be making sure our food supply is well-stocked from now on.

Te: What? Why me?

Mom: All we have is this land and a few resources.\
If we want this to be a home where everyone is welcome, we have to rely on each other first.

Te: Fine…I’ll go check the board.

Mom: I love you too, Gremlin.
