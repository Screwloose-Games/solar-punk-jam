Te: Hey, Trin, I brought you some food.

# Trin takes the food from Te.

Trin: ….

It’s raw.

Well, yeah. You have to cook it.

I’m not good at that and I think my dads are off taking samples.

Could you cook it for me?

No way.

I could ask my mom, but…she’s not the best either. Dad was the one who cooked all the time, before…

…

Sorry.

It’s ok.

Here. Jay and Kay thought you’d like this.

Candy!

Just say licorice, Trin.

…

Licorice.
