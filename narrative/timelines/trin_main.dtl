	Te: What're you doing with these plants?
	Trin: Cornus sericea!
	Te: Hunh?
	Trin: Some people call them Red Twig Dogwood.\
	Mine prefer to be called Kay and Jay.\ Their roots will help keep the soil from moving when it floods.
	Te: But...maybe it won't flood this time?
	Trin: It will eventually, but your mom and my dads are prepared.
	Trin: It won't be like last time.
