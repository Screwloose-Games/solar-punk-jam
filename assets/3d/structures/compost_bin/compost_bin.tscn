- As a player, I want the food I donate at the Food Stand to become tomorrowâ€™s waste and seeds.
- As a player, I want to retrieve food waste from the waste bin the next day, so I can reuse it as compost input.
- As a player, I want to add waste to a compost bin and have it convert into soil after a set amount of time (86 seconds), so I can continue planting crops.
- As a player, I want to collect soil from the compost bin after it's done processing, so I can use it to grow more food."
